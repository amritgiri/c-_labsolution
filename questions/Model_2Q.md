## Illustration of Constructor, Destructor, Array of objects, objects as arguments, friend function and friend class
1.	Define a class Box with private data members: length and breadth and height. Initialize its data members with some fixed values using a constructor. Use the object of that class and calculate volume of a box.
2.	WAP to illustrate the working of constructor and destructor. Use appropriate "cout" statements and blocks to show the sequence of object construction and destruction.
3.	Write a program in C++ which has class Employee with data members: name, address, age and salary and member functions read and display data members. Use this class to read records of 10 employees and display them.
4.	Define a class named Distance with meter and centimeter as private members. Use appropriate member functions to read and display data members. Use class Distance to read two objects of distance class and add them by passing this objects to the function and display the result.
5.	WAP to add and swap private data of two different classes. Use separate function for add and swap.
6.	WAP which has two classes as your choice such that function members of one class use private members of another class.
