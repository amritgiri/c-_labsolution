3.	WAP in C++ to illustrate the execution order of constructors and destructors when both the base and derived class has constructor and destructor in single and multiple inheritances.

4.	WAP to illustrate casting base class pointer to derived class pointer.

5.	WAP to create a class SHAPE with value as data member and constructor to initialize its data. Derive two Classes SQUARE and CIRCLE from SHAPE. Define FindPerimeter() in both the derived classes and find the perimeter of square and circumference of circle using value as length of square and radius of circle. Implement run time polymorphism using above classes.
